"""Action selector implementations.

Action selectors are objects that when called return a desired
action. These actions may be stochastically chosen (e.g. randomly chosen
from a list of candidates) depending on the choice of `ActionSelector`
implementation, and how it is configured.

Examples include the following
* `DeterministicActionSelector`: always returns the same (specified) action
* `UniformDiscreteActionSelector`: selections an action uniformly at random
  from a specified discrete action space
* `NoisyActionSelector`: uses either a "preferred" action selector (with
  probability `1 - epsilon`) or a "noise" action selector (with probability
  `epsilon`) to determine the action. Useful, for example, to implement an
  epsilon-greedy agent.
