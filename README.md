# Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

This repo contains a python package implementing various objects and functions associated with the topic of reinforcement learning that I have implemented while reading the textbook *Reinforcement Learning* by Sutton and Barto.

Please see [this repo](https://github.com/Sen-R/sutton-barto) for a collection of notebooks that use this code to reproduce results and help complete exercises set in that book.
