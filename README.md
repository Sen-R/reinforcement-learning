# Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

This repo contains:

1. A python package implementing various objects and functions associated with the topic of reinforcement learning that I have implemented while reading the textbook *Reinforcement Learning* by Sutton and Barto.
2. A collection of notebooks that use this code to reproduce results and help complete exercises set in that book.
